# Chapter 54: POSIX Shared Memory

## Ex. 54-1

**Question**

Rewrite the programs in **Listing 48-2** (*svshm_xfr_writer.c*)
and **Listing 48-3** (*svshm_xfr_reader.c*) to use POSIX shared
memory objects instead of System V shared memory.

**Answer**

See *pshm_writer.c* and *pshm_reader.c*

I also replaced the use of System V semaphores with POSIX
semaphores.
