// 10.9 - 10-1. Converting clock time to seconds.

/*
 * Assume a system where the value returned by the call sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) is
 * 100. Assuming that the clock_t value returned by times() is an unsigned 32-bit
 * integer, how long will it take before this value cycles so that it restarts at 0? Perform
 * the same calculation for the CLOCKS_PER_SEC value returned by clock().
 *
 * A 32 bit unsigned integer has a range from [0, 2^32)
 *
 * In order to get the time in seconds from the return value of times() we must divide
 * by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK). If this value is 100 then the total amount of time before
 * wrapping is (2^32 - 1) / 100 ~= 4.29E7 seconds or roughly 497 days.
 *
 * In order to get the time in seconds from the return value of clock() we must divide
 * by CLOCKS_PER_SEC. Therefore the total amount of time before wrapping would be
 * (2^32 - 1) / 1,000,000 ~= 4294.97 seconds or roughly 72 minutes.
