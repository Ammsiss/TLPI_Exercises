Viega & McGraw, 2002 covers a broad range of topics relating to the design and
implementation of secure software. General information about security on UNIX
systems, as well as a chapter on secure-programming techniques can be found in
Garfinkel et al., 2003. Computer security is covered at some length in Bishop,
2005, and at even greater length by the same author in Bishop, 2003. Peikari &
Chuvakin, 2004 describes computer security with a focus on the various means by
which system may be attacked. Erickson, 2008 and Anley, 2007 both provide a
thorough discussion of various security exploits, providing enough detail for wise
programmers to avoid these exploits. Chen et al., 2002 is a paper describing and
analyzing the UNIX set-user-ID model. Tsafrir et al., 2008 revises and enhances
the discussion of various points in Chen et al., 2002. Drepper, 2009 provides a
wealth of tips on secure and defensive programming on Linux.

Several sources of information about writing secure programs are available
online, including the following:

- **A useful checklist** for writing set-user-ID programs is available online at http://
www.homeport.org/~adam/setuid.7.html.

- Matt Bishop has written a range of security-related papers, which are available
online at http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ bishop/secprog. The most interesting of these is
“How to Write a Setuid Program,” (originally published in ;login: 12(1) Jan/Feb
1986). Although somewhat dated, this paper contains a wealth of useful tips.

- The Secure Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO, written by David Wheeler,
is available at http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/.
