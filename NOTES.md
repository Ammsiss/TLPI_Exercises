## TODO

- Centralize make file and add dependency tracking with .d files.
  This relies on going through the make book, which in turn relies
  on going through the bash tutorials.

- Finish skipped filesystem based exersises.

- Add a string <-> character comparison function. One that takes a
  string of individual characters and compares each one to a single
  specified character.
