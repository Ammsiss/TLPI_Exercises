# Chapter 28: Process Creation and Execution in More Detail
## Ex. 28-1

**Question**

Write a program to see how fast the *fork()* and *vfork()* system calls are on your
system. Each child process should immediately exit, and the parent should *wait()*
on each child before creating the next. Compare the relative differences for these
two system calls with those of **Table 28-3**. The shell built-in command *time* can be
used to measure the execution time of a program.
