## More Info

Refer to the sources of further information listed in Section 29.10.
The author of LinuxThreads documented the implementation in a web page
that can be found at http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads/. The NPTL imple-
mentation is described by its implementers in a (now somewhat out-of-date) paper
that is available online at http://people.redhat.com/drepper/nptl-design.pdf.
